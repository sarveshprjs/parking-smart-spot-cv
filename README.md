# 🚗 Smart Parking Spot Detection using Computer Vision

An AI-powered parking lot monitoring system that uses Computer Vision to detect whether parking spots are **empty** or **occupied** in real-time. Built using Python, OpenCV, Scikit-learn, and classical machine learning techniques.

---

## 📸 Project Overview

This project uses an SVM classifier to distinguish between images of **empty** and **occupied** parking spaces. The model is trained using a labeled image dataset and can be applied to real-time CCTV footage or individual frames to monitor parking space availability.
